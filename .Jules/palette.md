## 2024-05-22 - [Loading State & Empty States]
**Learning:** Users often feel uncertain when a search or filter action doesn't provide immediate feedback, especially with network latency. A simple "Searching..." text or spinner significantly improves perceived responsiveness. Similarly, empty tables can look like broken features; "Empty states" with actionable guidance ("Add your first transaction") turn a dead end into a clear path forward.
**Action:** Always include a visual indicator for any async network request (like search), and ensure every list/table has a helpful empty state.
